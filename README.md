# About

**GeoFont** is a simple typeface with the goal of being pleasant to look at in a variety of use cases. It was originally developed as a [resourcepack for Minecraft](https://github.com/Xetheon/mc-geometric-font) and was meant to resemble the default font used in the game: Mojangles.

Two versions of the font currently exist: GeoFont, and GeoFont Edge. The original version looks the most like Mojangles, while Edge has a more futuristic/cyber feel to it. OpenFont files are availible for both, as well as Glyphr Studio project files for easy editing.

## Usage

This font is under the [OFL (Open Font License)](https://github.com/Xetheon/GeoFont/blob/main/LICENSE). You are free to modify/use it in personal or commercial projects, and while you don't have to give credit, it's highly apreciated!
